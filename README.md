# Project Description
I aim to do a simulation of nature, simulating a green field of flowers growing and reproducing. The flowers will be procedurally generated using L-Systems, and will reproduce using a simulation of wind and maybe pollinators like bees. The field can also be produced using perlin noise.

In the initial repo, there is my implementation of an 3D L-System and a Stochastic L-System.

I'm using 'The Algorithmic Beauty Of Plants' by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer as reference which can be found for free here http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf
